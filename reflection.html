             <h3>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h3>
             <p>Responsive Web design is a concept that argues that design and development should adapt to the user's behavior and surroundings, taking into account screen size, platform, and orientation.

                Flexible grids and layouts, pictures, and judicious use of CSS media queries are all part of the process. When a user transitions from a laptop to an iPad, the website should adapt to the new device's resolution, picture size, and scripting capabilities. The user's device settings may also need to be considered; for example, if the user has a VPN for iOS on their iPad, the website should not limit the user's access to the page. In other words, the website should be equipped with technology that allows it to adapt to the user's choices automatically. This would eliminate the need for each new item on the market to go through a separate design and development phase.

             <h3>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h3>
             <p>RWD is a web development technique that allows a website's look to vary dynamically based on the screen size and orientation of the device being used to view it. RWD is one solution to the difficulty of designing for the wide range of devices that users have access to, from little phones to large desktop displays.
                Breakpoints are used in RWD to specify how a site's layout will appear: one design is applied above a breakpoint, while another design is applied below that breakpoint. Breakpoints are frequently determined by the browser's width.

             <h3>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
                research? </h3>
             <p>I have learnt the following:
                Software providers should optimize software, developing a common backend that serves web apps, in order to avoid extra development and maintenance costs.
                RESTful API allows developers to create a backend for web apps. This commonplace technology needs less bandwidth, making it more convenient. It has a unique software design that makes scaling, using, understanding, and maintaining it simple.
                The React.js view library may be used to create the web UI on the frontend. React.js stands apart from other frontend JavaScript frameworks because to its reactive data flow architecture. It only enables one-way data bindings, unlike frameworks like AngularJS, which drastically simplifies the rendering logic.

             <h3>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course. </h3>
             <p>I have really enjoyed learning in this course as this was my first step towards web development. By getting the skills from this course I can confidently say that I am an amateur web programmer. To be specific I really enjoyed the html and CSS but I got really confused at times understanding JavaScript. Our professor used to take in class Exam due to which all students prepared the syllabus well The one thing I like to mention is that this course is in Demand and will be in Demand as long as the internet is present. In WEB programming we can be creative and there are no limits! I can make colorful websites.</p>
